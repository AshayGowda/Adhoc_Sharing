Dynamic thresholding adjusts the threshold value based on the image content rather than using a fixed value. Here's how you can dynamically threshold high luminance objects in the mentioned scenarios:

1. **Outdoor Scenario: Adaptive Thresholding**
   - **Adaptive Thresholding:** Use adaptive thresholding techniques like Adaptive Mean or Gaussian Thresholding. These methods compute the threshold for a pixel based on the mean or Gaussian-weighted mean of its neighboring pixels.
   - **OpenCV Example:**
     ```python
     import cv2
     img = cv2.imread('outdoor.jpg', 0)
     adaptive_thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(img, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
     ```

2. **Office Scenario: Otsu's Method**
   - **Otsu's Method:** This method automatically calculates an optimal threshold by maximizing the variance between two classes of pixels.
   - **OpenCV Example:**
     ```python
     import cv2
     img = cv2.imread('office.jpg', 0)
     _, otsu_thresh = cv2.threshold(img, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
     ```

3. **Night Light Scenario: Adaptive Thresholding with Gaussian**
   - **Adaptive Thresholding with Gaussian:** Use Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding to handle the varying luminance levels effectively.
   - **OpenCV Example:**
     ```python
     import cv2
     img = cv2.imread('night.jpg', 0)
     adaptive_gaussian_thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(img, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
     ```

In these methods:
- **cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C** and **cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C** determine the method used for adaptive thresholding.
- The parameters **11** and **2** are the block size and the constant subtracted from the mean or weighted mean, respectively, in the adaptive thresholding methods.
- **cv2.THRESH_BINARY** sets the type of thresholding to binary.

By using these dynamic thresholding methods, you can adaptively determine the threshold based on the image content, which can lead to better segmentation results across different lighting conditions.
