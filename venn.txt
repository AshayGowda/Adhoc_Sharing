Sure! In OpenCV, when you perform an a - b operation between two images, you're essentially subtracting the pixel values of one image (b) from another image (a). The operation is applied pixel-wise, meaning the value of each pixel in image b is subtracted from the corresponding pixel value in image a.

Let's explain this in terms of Venn diagrams:

Imagine two circles representing the pixel values in image a and image b, respectively. Each circle contains unique pixel values, but there might be some overlap where the pixel values are the same in both images.

Image a Circle: This circle represents all the pixel values in image a.
Image b Circle: This circle represents all the pixel values in image b.
The overlap between these two circles represents the common pixel values present in both images.

When you subtract b from a (a - b), you are essentially removing the overlapping part (common pixel values) from the pixel values in image a.

Here's the logic:

If a pixel value exists in image a but not in image b, it remains unchanged in the result.
If a pixel value exists in image b but not in image a, it's not subtracted from anything, so it doesn't affect the result.
If a pixel value exists in both images, the pixel value in image b is subtracted from the corresponding pixel value in image a.
Venn Diagram Explanation:
Image a - Image b:
Unique to Image a: This represents the pixel values that are only present in image a and not in image b.
Overlap: This represents the common pixel values between image a and image b.
Unique to Image a: These pixels remain unchanged because there's no corresponding value to subtract from image b.
Overlap: These pixels get modified because you're subtracting the values from image b.

After the subtraction, you'll get a new image where:

Pixels that were unique to image a remain unchanged.
Pixels that were part of the overlap are modified based on the subtraction.
This operation is particularly useful in image processing tasks like image enhancement, background subtraction, or creating difference images
